      <h2>May be "Butch Cassidy's Gang"</h2>
        <p> According to an Ogden dispatch railroad men of that city believe
        that “Butch: Cassidy and his gang of Wyoming “hold in the wall”
        country held up the Southern Pacific passenger train No. 10 near
        Port Costa, Cal., last Sunday. </p>
        <p><b>April 23, 1910</b></p>

      <h2>Met "Butch" Cassidy</h2>
        <p>John Gitting, who used to be deputy sheriff in this country,
          and who is now generally riding down on the desert, says:
          “Last Sunday I was riding after cattle and when night fell I
          pitched camp near the Big Hole on the Green River road ad was
          surprised very shortly after dark to see a horseman ride up
          and dismount. I immediately recognized “Butch Cassidy, for it
          was non other than he, and he was loaded to the muzzle, carrying
          two six-shooters and a Winchester. I was unarmed, and he prepared
          to camp with me, though I believe others of his party were near by,
          and his sole purpose was to “pump” me about matters which he knew
          me to be acquainted with, but I would give him no satisfaction,
          and finally turned the conversation to the Montpelier bank robbery.
          He made no ‘bones’ about his connection with that affair, and
          laughingly averred that there was not much in that layout, but he
          was now ‘on’ to a bigger haul than that made at Montpelier. Cassidy
          was no at all nervous, and in the morning after breakfast he saddled
          up, adjusted his Winchester and rode off toward the Buckhorn Mountains,
          stating that he was gong to make for Colorado.”
          <!--<br>-->
          Gitting claims he could have easily captured “Butch” had he been armed,
          but he thinks it was safer to not be hunting a man like Cassidy, anyhow."</p>

        <h2>Outlaws are in the South.</h2>
            <p>Cassidy and Lay said to have been seen in Wayne County. Anxious for
              a paper. Wanted to read about the bank robbery.</p>
            <p>A herald correspondent meets with men at Loa who acts suspiciously
              while sheriff coons. of Richfield, makes the positive statement that
              the outlaws were seen in Thurber by persons who know them well.
              LOA, Wayne Co., Sept 14, 1896.—Yesterday (Sunday) two young men on
              horseback rode into Loa, and put up at the Blackburn house for dinner.
  	          Both men had fine grey horses, with new saddles, end each has a Winchester rifle
              and a revolver. After caring for their horses, they asked if they
              could get a late Salt Lake paper, remarking that they wanted to see
              the latest news concerning the Montpelier bank robbery.
  	          The lady of the house, Mrs. Thomas Blackburn, not having the latest paper, a
              neighbor kindly volunteered the use of his, which he hastened to
              get. Both men were noticed to be deeply interested in looking over
              the telegraphic news, which caused some little anxiety among those
              present. When asked to their business, they replied, “Cattle buyers,”
              and said they were on their way to Escalante, but immediately after
              dinner took down the Dirty Devil, in the direction of the Henry Mountains.
  	          After finishing their dinner they were fallowed into the barn,
              where they were saddling their horses. They seemed to be uneasy and
              took considerable time in making ready to start, taking several drinks
              of whisky (of which article they seemed well supplied.) Then taking
              from where they had them concealed, their Winchesters jumped their
              horses and rode rapidly away. Both were young men. One was light
              completed, about 5 feet 10 inches in height, and weighted about 180
              pounds. The other, about same height, but dark, nose and chin
              prominent. Neither had been shaven for a week or ten days. Whether
              they are of the robber gang or not, they acted very queerly.
              <br>
              <h3><b>A corroboration.</b></h3>
                <p>Ogden, Sept. 16. –Jacob Evans yesterday received a message from
                  Richfield in Sevier County, saying that Cassidy and Lay were seen
                  in that vicinity Monday. The message was as follows:
                  “To prosecuting Attorney Evans or Sheriff Wright –Cassidy and Lay
                  seen in Thruber, Wayne county, Monday. 4 p.m., going east, riding
                  Vernal horses, by parties who know them.“J.W. Coons, Sheriff.”</p>
              <h3><b>Cassidy Confesses</b></h3>
                  <p>Joe Decker, a travelling man, has arrived here from Wayne county.
                    He says he met two men over there who were buying cattle.
                  	One said to him: “Mr. Decker, I am Butch Cassidy, the notorious
                    outlaw, and I haven’t been near Ogden since September 7. In a
                    little while we will go back to Vernal, where any officer with
                    a warrant my arrest either of us with no trouble. I have led a
                    reckless life of late years, and would do Matt Warner any good
                    I could but I had nothing to do with that Montpelier bank robbery”
                  	Butch then showed Decker what he could do with his rifle, and
                    said he would surrender to any peace officer who came without
                    a posse.</p>
                <p><b>September 17, 1896</b></p>

        <h2>Northwest Notes</h2>
          <p>Report comes from Willows, Wyo., that the Butch Cassidy gang of
            outlaws have made a raid through that section of country and driven
            off over 200 head of horses. Mr. Watt, a sheepherder, saw them and
            tried to stop them, but their rifles drove him away. </p>
