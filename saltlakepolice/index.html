          <p>Passed through Emery going to the Roost.<br>Made some social calls
              and deported himself like a man of ease, naturally amused at the
              obitual notices he receives from time to time. </p>
              <p>Robbers are probably reinforcing, as strange outfits are seen
                heading for the rendezvous every now and then.</p>

              <p><b>Castle Dale, Aug. 8.</b> – There is no longer any doubt as to the
                whereabouts of Butch Cassidy, the notorious outlaw. He passed
                through this county last week on his way to the Robbers’ Roost, and
                made a social call on a few of his old acquaintances on the way. He
                spent a night at the ranch of Billy Bower, in Grand county, en route
                from Green River to his old stronghold, and send messages of regard
                to several of his old friends in this county A gentleman who is well
                known in this vicinity, and who passed through Castle Dale yesterday,
                had a lengthy consultation with the outlaw at the Bower ranch, and he
                says Butch was a greatly amused at the idea which prevailed in some
                quarters that his mortal remains were resting beside those of Joe
                Walker in the graveyard at Price.</p>
                <p> He gave no information as to where he had been sojourning for
                the past few months, but that the people
                of this part of Utah will hear fro his again in the near future there
                is no doubt. </p>
                <p>James McPhearson, the man who guided the sheriff’s
                posse to the sleeping place of Joe Walker and his companions on the
                morning of the tragedy, and who has a ranch in that neighborhood,
                is selling his cattle and horses as rapidly as possible and will
                leave this country without any unnecessary delay. </p>
                <p>Thompson and Schultz, the two men who were arrested at the time Walker and
                Herring were shot and who were acquitted of any complicity in the
                crimes charged to these outlaws at the last term of court held
                here, are now working on the Bower ranch, in the neighborhood of the
                Robbers’ Roost. It is supposed the outlaws at the Roost are being
                reinforced, as a number of mysterious outfits have been seen recently
                heading for Blake, the nearest supply point for the robbers’
                headquarters. </p>
