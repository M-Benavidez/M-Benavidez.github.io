            Butch Cassidy Again!

          <h4>
            Passed through Emery going to the Roost. Made some social calls
              and deported himself like a man of ease, naturally amused at the
              obitual notices he receives from time to
              time. Robbers are probably reinforcing, as strange outfits are seen
              heading for the rendezvous every now and then.

          <p> There is no longer any doubt as to the
            whereabouts of Butch Cassidy, the notorious outlaw. He passed
            through this county last week on his way to the Robbers’ Roost, and
            made a social call on a few of his old acquaintances on the way. He
            spent a night at the ranch of Billy Bower, in Grand county, en route
            from Green River to his old stronghold, and send messages of regard
            to several of his old friends in this county A gentleman who is well
            known in this vicinity, and who passed through Castle Dale yesterday,
            had a lengthy consultation with the outlaw at the Bower ranch, and he
            says Butch was a greatly amused at the idea which prevailed in some
            quarters that his mortal remains were resting beside those of Joe
            Walker in the graveyard at Price.</p>
            <p> He gave no information as to where he had been sojourning for
            the past few months, but that the people
            of this part of Utah will hear fro his again in the near future there
            is no doubt. </p>
            <p>James McPhearson, the man who guided the sheriff’s
            posse to the sleeping place of Joe Walker and his companions on the
            morning of the tragedy, and who has a ranch in that neighborhood,
            is selling his cattle and horses as rapidly as possible and will
            leave this country without any unnecessary delay. </p>

          <p>Thompson and Schultz, the two men who were arrested at the time Walker and

          Robbers’ Roost. It is supposed the outlaws at the Roost are being

            End of the Outlaws that Terrorized Four States
          </h2>
          <h4></h4>
        </header>

        <p>Last month a story appeared in The Sunday Call narrating that the
        Governors of Wyoming, Utah and Colorado and combined to run down the
        “Butch” Cassidy gang of outlaws that had been terrorizing five States
        for several years. Since the publication of the story the outlaws have been run to
        earth, the chief members killed and the remainder put where they
        will do no further harm to the community.</p>
        <p>“Butch” Cassidy leader of the “Robbers’ Roost” gang, was killed this
        morning near Thompsons Springs, on the Rio Grande Western, 200 miles
        south of this city. George Walker, one of Cassidy’s Lieutenants, was
        also killed, while Lay, another leader, was taken prisoner, along
        with a fourth man named Thompson. The killing was done by a posse
        from Price, Utah, which has been on the trail since Sunday. There
        were eight men in the posse.</p>
        <p>On Sunday the bandits, then five in number, held up two men in Box
          Canyon, near Price, and drove off a bunch of cattle. As similar
          performances have been frequent lately, a number of determined men
          resolved to run down the outlaws. They came upon them at 5 o’clock
          this morning, four miles north of Thompsons, on the Book Cliffs.</p>

        <div id="more2">
          <p>The bandits made a hard fight. Cassidy and Walker were particularly
             desperate in their resistance, and when both fell dead their rifles
              and six-shooters were empty. Lay, on the men captured, assisted
              Cassidy in holding up Sales Agent Carpenter of PV. Coal Company
              at midday at Castle Gate a year and a half ago. They secured
              $8,000 on that occasion. Though a dozen posses were sent in
              pursuit of them from different points, they eluded them all,
              and escaped to their mountain dens in safety.</p>
            <p>The identification of Cassidy was accomplished through a
              picture taken when in the Wyoming penitentiary. Although
              Lay had been under suspicion for a long time, his connection
              with the cattle thieves was the first positive proof of his
              criminality. He has posed as good citizen of Vernal, whose
              occasional extended absences from home were never explained.</p>
            <p>In all, rewards aggregating several thousand dollars will come
              to the men who fought the battle this morning and rid the States
              of Utah and Wyoming and Colorado as well of two of the most
              desperate men roaming their borders. </p>

            Butch Cassidy is Still Alive!
          </h2>
          <h4> King of outlaws was not killed. Wyoming Sheriff Examines the body.
            Asserts positively it is not that of Cassidy.
          </h4>
        </header>
        <p>Butch Cassidy, the famous outlaw, is still alive. The body of the
        man who was killed by the posse and buried with Walker was today exhumed
        in order to forever settle his identity, and it is now certain that
        the body is not that of Cassidy.</p>
        <p>Sheriff J. H. Ward of Evanston, Wyo., who is probably the best
        posted man in the inter-mountain states upon criminal matters,
        reached Price this morning in response to a telegram calling him
        here to identify the men in jail, and the corpse supposed to be that
        of Cassidy. Sheriff Ward for 13 years past has been a sheriff in Wyoming,
        and during that time had Cassidy in his jail for three months and was
        with him daily.</p>
        <p>On inspecting the body, Sheriff Ward positively asserted that it was
        not Cassidy, and that while the complexion and build of the men were
        very similar, the body in no other particular resembled Cassidy, and
        bore non of the battle scars of the famous robber. Sheriff Ward is of
        the opinion that the body is that of Bob Culp, alias Red Bob, a
        notorious cattle thief, from Wyoming. Cassidy was in jail awaiting
        trial for horse stealing, and a close description was made by Sheriff
        Ward of all his peculiar marks, and he is absolutely positive that
        this is not the man.</p>

          <p>Special Agent Shores of the Rio Grande Western railway, who has had
          many experiences in criminal matters, and who possesses a good picture
          of Cassidy and has an accurate description taken from the penitentiary
          records of Wyoming, where Cassidy was formerly confined, concurs in the
          opinion of Sheriff Ward and your correspondent, that Walker’s companion
          in the Price graveyard is no Cassidy.</p>
          <p>Much regret is expressed by our citizens, who had hoped Sheriff Allred
          would be more adequately rewarded for his daring and bravery in going
          into the lair of the outlaws, through strange passes and dangerous
          trails, in the darkness of night, and so completely surprising the band
          of assassins, whose retreat would in all probability have never been
          trespassed upon had it not been for the intrepidity and determination
          of Sheriff Allred.</p>

          Thompson who were captured alive, are not so far fully identified,
          but Sheriff Ward is of the opinion that they belong to the
          Hole-in-the-Wall gang of cattle thieves in Wyoming, and will investigate
          their records further upon his return home</p>

            Cassidy's Wyoming Career
          </h2>
          <h4>While attempts are now being made to drive the “Robbers’ Roost”
          gang of outlaws out of northwestern Colorado and corners of Wyoming
          and Utah, it may interest the public to recall the history of Butch
          Cassidy in Wyoming, who is said to be the leader of this gang of
          desperate outlaws.</h4>
        </header>
        <p> Butch Cassidy came into Wyoming about 1893, accompanied
        by a desperate character known as Al Heiner. They made their
        headquarters at Lander, Fremond County, and had some $8,00 to
        $10,00 in money, which is now supposed to be the result of a bank
        robbery at Telluride, Colo., some months before. They spent this
        money lavishly in the saloons of Lander and elsewhere in the state,
        and made a great many friends among the tough element then living in
        west central Wyoming.</p>
        <span id="click4" onclick="showMore(4)">
          read more
        </span>
        <div id="more4">
          <p>  In the latter part of 1893, or early in 1894, Cassidy and Heiner
            were arrested for horse stealing and vigorously prosecuted at
            Lander by Judge Jay L. Towey, the manager of the Embar Cattle
            company. In the trial at Lander in 1894 Heiner was acquitted,
            but Cassidy was convicted under circumstances which entitled him
            to ten years in the penitentiary, as the limit of the law. It was
            feared at the time that an attempt would be made to rescue Cassidy
            before he could be taken to the penitentiary.</p>
            <p>However, much to the
            disappointment of the stockmen and law abiding citizens, the judge
            gave Cassidy only two years, and he went quietly and unmolested to
            the penitentiary at Laramie. But before his short term had expired
            Governor Richards pardoned Cassidy and turned him loose upon the
            people of western Wyoming. Leading citizens of western Wyoming
            reproached the governor for his act, but the governor claimed that
            the petition that he had received justified him in the pardon.
            Butch Cassidy’s career since getting out of the Wyoming penitentiary
            has been that of a desperado who has made nothing but care and expense
            for the officers of western counties. </p>

      <p> A robbery which for pure daring and recklessness deserves to be
          classed with the exploits of the James gang, was committed yesterday
          at Castle Gate, the headquarters of the P.V. Coal company.</p>

          <p> E. L. Carpenter of this city, the cashier of the company, went down
              to Castle Gate yesterday to pay off the men, and on the train with
              him went $9,800 needed for that purpose, the cash going by express.
              The robbers secured all of this but $2,000, and the manner in which
              the job was done clearly shows that they were acquainted with Mr.
              Carpenter by sight and knew the object of his visit, for they went
              about their desperate work without the least hesitation. Fortunately,
              the cashier escaped without injury, but it is possible that one of the
              desperadoes was wounded in the melee that followed the robbery.
          <p>	Mr. Carpenter is well known in Salt Lake and is as plucky a little
              man as walks. He resides at 198 S Street and his wife, who is at
              home, last night expressed her satisfaction to a Herald reporter
              that her husband escaped without injury. That he did so is doubtless
              due to the suddenness of the attack, which gave him no opportunity
              to put up a fight.</p>

            <p><br>STORY OF THE ROBBERY.<br></p>
            <p>	One of the most daring and successful hold-ups on record, occurred
              today at about 12:30 o’clock at Castle Gate. This is or should have
              been pay day for the coal miners there and $9,800 came down on No.
              2 Rio Grande Western which reached here at 12:26 p.m. When the train
              reached Castle Gate the money was delivered by the express agent to
              E. L. Carpenter, paymaster of the P.V. Coal Company, who was with
              T.W. Lewis, an employee of the company. They crossed over the tracks
              and went onto the platform in front of the Wasatch store. The passenger
              train pulled out for Helper and about 100 men or more were congregated
              around the store and in the road near the post office, which is closed
              at hand. Two rough individuals who had been loitering around town and
              in the saloon all day yesterday were also there with their horses.
              Just as Mr. Carpenter was nearing the outside stairs at the east
              side of the building leading up to the P.V. Coal company’s office
              over the store, one of these individuals dismounted and placing a
              six-shooter in Carpenter’s face said: “Drop them sacks,” and “hold
              up your hands.” At the same time the second robber was whirling a
              six-shooter in his hand an firing shots promiscuously to create
              consternation. Carpenter and his deputy compiled with the highwayman’s
              request when the bold outlaw immediately secured the money and handing
              it to his pal, stared off down the canyon. The horse belonging to the
              man who did the work got loose during the excitement and he had to run
              300 yards down the road to catch it, but in the meantime the other
              hold-up was riding at breakneck speed away with the boodle. Mr.
              Lewis managed to escape into the store with one sack of silver
              containing $1,000 and the other sack of silver was either dropped
              or thrown away by the departing robber and was picked up a short
              distance from the store, but the satchel containing greenbacks and
              gold amounting in all to $7,800 was successfully made away with.</p>
          <p><br> ALL WERE RATTLED<br></p>
            <p> 	No one in all that crowd of men had a gun and everybody was
            rattled and did not hardly realize what had happened until too late.
            Three shots, however, were fired at the retreating highwaymen from
            upstairs windows of the office to no effect. Down the canyon they
            rode fully half a mile through the thickly settled part of the town
            before getting away from the houses. Just north of the Half Way
            house the fugitives cut all telegraph wires, apparently to keep the
            news from reaching Sheriff Donant at Price, and in this, for a time
            all least, they were successful. On thev spend and with no on in
            pursuit until they reachel Spring creek canyon, half a mile north of
            Helper. Crossing the mouth of this canyon they evidently took the
            trail leading across the foothills and came down past Garden creek,
            keeping two or three miles away and back from the railroad and farms
            in Price canyon, making a straight cut across the country, striking
            the main Price and Huntington road in Emery county at about 2:30
            p.m., in Washboard flat, for just about that time the telephone wire
            running south to Price through Emery county was also cut. This was
            done too late for their purpose, however, as word had already
            reached here and messages were sent to Cleveland, Huntington and
            Castledale to at once organize posses and be in readiness to
            intercept the robbers. By this time, 7p.m., they are well out of
            reach and in the vicinity of their rendezvous in San Rafael county,
            if not overtaken or intercepted by some of the numerous posses sent
            out. In about 30 minutes after the robbery at Castle Gate an engine
            was secured and Mr. E.L. Carpenter and Mr. Robert Dickson of Price,
            and eye witness to the robbery, and other boarded t and began a
            chase down the canyon, but they got no sight of the men and came on
            the Price. Sheriff Donan hastily gathered a posse of four men who,
            armed with Winchester rifles and well mounted, started off south
            toward Cleveland at 2 p.m., so they were but a few miles behind the
            escaping desperadoes, but will probably not overtake them, as the
            outlaws were riding two good mustangs.</p> <p><br> REWARD
            OFFERED</p>
            	<p>Mr. Carpenter immediately offered reward of $2,00 for their
            	capture, or $1,000 for the return of the money. At 3 p.m. another
            	posse left Price for Emery county, and they returned at 6 o’clock,
            	upon hearing of the robbers being so far ahead of them. At 4:30
            	p.m. the telephone wire was repaired. It had been cut nine miles
            	south of Price. The first message received over the wire was to
            	the effect that two men having white and bay horses and answering
            	to the description to the robbers had been seen off east of
            	Cleveland. At 6:30 p.m. the mall arrived from Emery county and the
            	carrier stated that he met the two bandits just this side of
            	Cleveland and about 15 miles from Price, and that those two men
            	kept several rods away from him and the road, but he noticed them
            	particularly. One man was smooth shaved and wore a blue coat and
            	black hat, and the other a broad and light hat, so these were most
            	assuredly the thieves. Mr. Carpenter returned to Castle Gate on
            	tonight’s train and will again return to Price on the midnight
            	train, when the expects a posse of officers from Salt Lake City.
            	These parties are supposed to be Butch Cassidy and Tom
            	Gissell.</p>
          <p><br>ANOTHER VERSION</p>
            	<p>E. L. Carpenter, paymaster of the Pleasant Valley Coal company,
                was held up and robbed of over $7,00 in front of the Pleasant Valley
                Coal company’s office at Castle Gate today at 12:45 p.m.
            	The deed was committed in the presence of two or three dozen spectators,
              who were too much surprised to realize what was going on until the
              hold-up was over, and the robbers far down the canyon with their
              horses on the run.</p>
            	<p>It is presumed a third man was left at the lower part of town
                to cut the telegraph wire, as the wires were found to be cut and
                communication stopped east a few moments after the hold-up occurred.
            	An armed posse was at once organized and started in pursuit, while
              another party boarded a light engine passing and rapidly covered
              the ground between here and Price.</p>
            	<p>All the mountain passes and places of egress are being protected
                and watched, and as the robbers had but a few minutes the lead they
                undoubtedly will have a hard time to make a successful escape.
                Both men were apparently under 25 years and general appearances
                indicate that they were cowboys or range riders.</p>
            	<p>One robber was about five feet five; wore blue overalls, brown
                coat, soft hat; had reddish hair and was sunburned in the face.
                The other robber was about five feet, eight inches, wore blue
                overalls, dark coat, soft hat, and was of rather light complexion.
            	One thousand dollars reward has been offered by the officers of
              the Pleasant Valley Coal Company for the capture of the robbers and
               $1,000 for the recovery of the money.</p>
            	<p>The hold-up occurred just as Mr. Carpenter started to ascend the
                stairs to the company’s offices with the several bags of coin.
                He was suddenly confronted by a man with two drawn revolvers,
                who ordered him to hold up his hands, which eh did without loss
                 of time.<p>
            	<p>A boy, who held one sack, hesitated and was promptly knocked
                down by a blow across the temple with the butt of the robber’s
                revolver. Hastily gathering together the money, the robbers
                sprang on to their horses and beat a hasty retreat, amid a
                volley of fun shots between the robbers and citizens, some of
                the latter having by this time got on a scene with weapons.
            	A satchel that was dropped by the robbers had blood on it and it
               may be some of the shots took effect. One man was arrested this
               afternoon on suspicion, but it was decided he know nothing about it,
               although he is still held in custody awaiting developments.
            	But little information thus far has been received from the
              different posses, but some definite report is expected before morning,
              the latest rumors from the field being that the robbers passed through
              Cleveland at 3 p.m. on their way to Robbers’ Roost, and a posse, armed
              with Winchesters, is hot on the trail.
            	The robbers acted with the utmost coolness, and the affair was
              evidently well planned.</p>

          the San Miguel Valley bank was out making collections, three men
          entered the bank and demanded the funds of the bookkeeper at the

          fourth robber who was holding their horses just outside the bank.
          They left town on the run, firing shots in the air to frighten the
          citizens. It is not yet known just what amount they secured, probably
          only a few thousands. They are heading for the Arizona line, with
          the sheriff’s part in pursuit, and unless they have a change of
          horses, it is more than probably that they will be captured
          before twenty-four hours.</p>

            Rounding Up Outlaws in the Colorado Basin
          </h2>
          <h4> Active Campaign by the Governors of Four
            States Against “Butch” Cassidy and His 500 Freebooters.</h4>
        </header>
        <p>“Butch” Cassidy is a bad man.
          He is the worst man in four States. These States are Utah,
          Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming, and when the four Governors met in
          secret conclave on Monday it was far the purpose of deciding upon
          a plan of campaign against the most notorious outlaw the West has
          ever had to cope with. The achievements of Jesse James and his
          followers pale into tawdry insignificance before those of “Butch”
          Cassidy and his five hundred. For several years—in fact, ever since
          the Live Stock Commission drove the Wyoming rustlers out of
          business in 1892 – “Butch” has proven a thorn in the flesh of the
          authorities of the four States in which he carries on his operations.
          He has laughed the militia to scorn. Sheriffs and deputies he regards
          with pity and contempt. He is a power unto himself.</p>
        <p>After the ordinary methods of hunting outlaws had been tried
          unsuccessfully it was decided that drastic means must be employed.
          Rewards have been repeatedly offered for “Butch” Cassidy, dead or
          live, and after each fresh outbreak these rewards have invariably
          been increased. If all the offers which have been made from time
          to time hold good, the slayer of “Butch” should he ever live to
          claim his reward, would be entitled to upward of $20,00 in blood money.</p>
        <span id="click8" onclick="showMore(8)">
          read more
        </span>
        <div id="more8">
          <p>But the rewards have proven as futile as have the efforts of the
            militia and the deputy sheriffs. And that is why Governor Wells
            of Utah, Governor Adams of Colorado, Governor Richards of Wyoming
            and Governor Steunenberg of Idaho got their heads together to see
            what could be done. Just what the result of their conference was
            has not been divulged.</p>
          <p>The Governors believe in still hunt methods, and it is thought that
          a large number of experienced mountaineers and bandit hunters will be
          placed in the filed, each State to furnish its quota, and that the
          bandits will be rounded up in much the same fashion that cattle are.
          Any attempts to exterminate this desperate band is certain to be
          attended by bloodshed.</p> <p>“Butch” and his band are the outgrowth
          of the rustlers of six years ago. Since then they have broadened their
          field and increased their numbers. It is no idle boast to say that the
          leader of this notorious band has five hundred men at his beck and
          call.</p> <p>Their depredations are upon a scale never before reached
          in the history of frontier crime. All the conditions are favorable to
          them. They know every foot of the vast territory in which they
          operate, taking in, as it does, the wildest and most inaccessible
          portions of four states. Every man of them is thoroughly familiar with
          frontier life in its rougher phases.</p> <p>The forces are subdivided
          into five Utah, and almost ot the Arizona line. Marauding and
          murderous bands conduct their raids without restraint. The thefts of
          livestock run into the millions. Ranchmen are murdered and driven out
          of business, and the officers of the law are powerless.</p> <p>There
          are five camos where the various bands maker their headquarters, each
          of which is well nigh inaccessible except to the bandits themselves.
          Two of the most famous are “Robbers’ Roost” and “Hole in the Wall.”
          The former is in South Central Utah on the San Rafaele River, a few
          miles west of the Green River. The latter is hidden away somewhere in
          that wild, mountainous district to the northwest of Casper, Wyo.</p>
          <p>The other camps are located in Teton Basin, near the eastern border
          of Idaho and south of the Snake River; Powder Springs in Southwestern
          Wyoming, near Colorado, and about fifty miles east of the Utah line;
          and Browns Park, taking in the northwester corner of Colorado and the
          northeastern portion of Utah. It is not definitely known in just which
          State the Browns Park camp lies, but it is thought to be across the
          line in Colorado. </p> <p>Never before in the record of border
          outlawry have Western States been forced to form an offensive and
          defensive alliance against bandits such as was entered into last week
          at Salt Lake by the Governors of these four States. The situation had
          become desperate and a desperate remedy was required. </p> <p>The five
          camps form a chain extending for hundreds of miles. Between these
          posts communication is maintained by a regular system of couriers and
          cipher dispatches, facilitating the co-operation of two or more bands
          when an enterprise of more than usual magnitude is undertaken.</p>
          <p>These reckless bands are composed of men of the most reckless and
          desperate character, long accustomed to deeds of crime. Whenever a
          murder is committed in the mountain States or a convict escapes from a
          penitentiary the criminal flees to the nearest of these retreats,
          where he is safe from pursuit. In this manner the ranks of the bandits
          have been recruited up to a strength conservatively estimated at five
          hundred. While each band has its chosen leader, “Butch” Cassidy
          exercises some sort of authority over the federation.</p> <p>Each of
          the strongholds is both a rendezvous and a fortress absolutely
          impregnable. They can only be reached by traversing deep and narrow
          gorges, scaling lofty and rugged peaks and penetrating the wildest
          recesses of the Rocky Mountains. In many places the only trail lies
          over a narrow shelf or precipice. Holes have been drilled, into which
          in case of close pursuit dynamite can be placed and the trail blown
          from the face of the cliff into the chasm below, thus baffling all
          pursuers.</p> <p>There are also many places where one robber can hold
          fifty officers at bay, and as the bandits are armed to the teeth and
          will fight to the last man, any effort to exterminate them by the
          ordinary processes of law is regarded as a useless sacrifice of life.
          In their retreats are numerous caves, luxuriously fitted up and
          containing subsistence sufficient for months. Thus are the bandits
          enabled to set at defiance all the forces of law and order.</p> <p>The
          outlaws roam the adjacent country and smaller settlements without
          molestation. Many settlers purchase immunity by extending assistance
          in various ways, and the robbers even attend country dances and other
          functions, occasionally “shooting up” the town or indulging in other
          forms of recreation. It is only when closely pursued by officers of
          the law that they retire to their mountain retreats.</p> <p>“Butch”
          Cassidy however, by reason of the price upon his head, considers the
          higher altitude more conducive to his health and seldom ventures into
          the towns, unless he is making a raid or is surrounded by a band of
          this trusty men, in which case he never fears molestation. As a killer
          he has earned a reputation during the last ten years probably equaled
          in the West only by that of “Wild Bill” Hickok, peace to his
          ashes.</p> <p>Few men who know him would care to rouse his ire, for
          although a man of wonderful nerve, unlike most of his class, he is
          possessed of a fearful temper. Sometimes it gets beyond his control,
          and then he throws all caution to the wind and becomes utterly
          reckless.</p> <p>About four years ago he was shot at from ambush near
          Green River by a cowboy known as “Hackey” Hughes, whose only object
          was to secure the reward offered by the State authorities of Utah. The
          bullet pierced the lobe of his ear, and the blood streaming down his
          face acted upon Cassidy as a red flag might to a maddened bull.</p>
          <p>With a howl of rage he turned his horse just as another bullet
          passed through the rim of his sombrero. A puff of smoke from a clump
          of bushes showed where the assassin was concealed. For picturesque
          profanity “Butch” Cassidy hasn’t his equal in the States, and on that
          occasion he is said to have fairly surpassed himself. Ripping out a
          string of oaths that would reach from Dan to Beersheba he jumped from
          his horse and dodged behind a boulder.</p> <p>He waited for twenty
          minutes, and then the cowboy shot the outlaw’s horse, which had been
          grazing the open. That was more than “Butch” could stand. Throwing
          caution to the winds he ran toward the clump of bushes, with a pistol
          in each hand barking at every step.</p> <p>But Hughes, considering
          discretion the better part of valor, had jumped on his horse and
          succeeded in making good his escape. But the vindictive nature of
          “Butch Cassidy asserted itself. He had recognized his assailant, and
          every member of the band received instructions to be on the watch for
          him. Hughes left the Green River country, and it was not until six
          months later that he was located, on the north fork of the Powder
          River, up in Wyoming.</p> <p>Cassidy was notified, and with a dozen
          picked men he reached the ranch where Hughes was working. It was
          during the spring roundup. The two men met face to face. Hughes knew
          what was coming and pulled his gun.  But he wasn’t quick enough.
          Cassidy’s pistol cracked first, and the cowboy dropped from his saddle
          with a bullet through his right eye.</p> <p>“That’s the way I serve
          any skunk that tries to shoot me in the back” remarked Cassidy. “If
          any of his friends want to take up the quarrel I’m ready.”</p> <p>But
          if the dead cowboy had any friends they railed to respond. “Butch”
          Cassidy was well known, and it wasn’t safe to pick quarrels with him.
          So he road away with his escort, cursing the cowboys for a pack of
          cowardly coyotes.</p> <p>Cattle-stealing is the chief source of income
          to Cassidy and his followers. One company alone in Central Utah has
          lost 200 head during the past two years, worth at present prices
          $80,00. These were driven through Colorado and into New Mexico. It is
          in driving these stolen cattle from one State to another and out of
          the country that their system of co-operation is beneficial.</p>
          <p>However any operation that promises adventure and financial reward
          is never overlooked. Trains are held up, express companies and banks
          are robbed, and even individuals, when known to have money in their
          possession, are relieved of their possessions in true road-agent
          style.</p> <p>There are women among these outlaws, too, who ride with
          them on their wild forays and take pride in their association with
          these bold and daring freebooters. Even “Calamity Jane,” in the old
          days of her association with “Deadwood Dick,” could not surpass these
          picturesque females in their wild career.</p> <p>About a year ago
          “Butch” Cassidy and “Bill” Ferguson, one of this trusted lieutenants,
          dashed into the town of Price in broad daylight, held up the paymaster
          of the coal company and rode of with $8,000 before the crowed of
          bystanders realized what had happened. This is but a sample
          exploit.</p> <p>Bank robberies are but side issues with them; merely
          incidental to their grand chief occupation of cattle-stealing. If a
          victim resists or an officer pursues murder is regarded as a
          professional duty, to be cheerfully performed, but they are not given
          to wanton slaughter. In several instances foolhardy officers who have
          invaded their strongholds have been disarmed, dismounted and set
          home.</p> <p>An instance of this kind occurred just after the raid on
          the coal company at Price. Two deputies traced Cassidy and Ferguson to
          the lair at “Robbers’ Roost.” They were fully twenty-four hours
          behind, and their approach was known long before they arrived at the
          narrow trail leading up into the rendezvous. Cassidy was in a jovial
          mood, and he conceived that it would be more fun to capture the
          deputies and make sport of them than to kill them. So he acted
          accordingly.</p> <p>The deputies were about half way up the trail
          when, just at a bend around a sharp point of rocks, they heard the
          sharp command “Hands up!”</p> <p>Half a dozen guns were staring them
          in the face not twenty paces away. The deputies realized that not to
          obey meant sudden death. Up went their hands. Cassidy stepped up to
          them, roaring with laughter.</p> <p>“You’re a couple of fine dubs to
          come and catch peaceable citizens, ain’t you?” he cried. “Gimme your
          guns. Here, Buck.” Calling to one of his men. “Search these
          tenderfeet, and if they’ve got any tobacco you can keep it.” The
          outcome of it was that the deputies, relieved of everything but their
          clothing, were bound hand and foot to their horses, conducted to the
          foot of the pass and sent about their business. To add to their
          discomfiture a rudely scrawled not was pinned on the breast of each,
          which read: WE ARE DEPUTY SHERIFFS, Sent out to capture Butch Cassidy
          and his gang. When found send us home.</p>
