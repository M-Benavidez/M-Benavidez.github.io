    <p> Why <i>"Oh Hello, on Broadway?"</i></p>
    <p> I do not have a Twitter account and as a result I am not actively engaged
      with any account in particular. I do however have a Netflix account and a fondness for comedy.
      I have been a fan of John Mulaney's work since his 2012 special, "New in Town" and this summer
      Netflix released his latest project, "Oh Hello, on Broadway". The play stars John Mulaney and Nick Knoll
      as the geriatric roommates George St. Geegland and Gil Faizon. I found the play
      to be a lovely combination of novel and amusing. I chose the @OhHello account since I assumed it would
      contain funny material with interesting pictures. It did not let me down.</p>

      <p>The tweets chosen vary in time frame and in some cases were showcased out of order.
      Older tweets were generally placed first to create the idea of a chronological starting point.
      They were organized by relevance to one another and were given titles
      that mimicked what could potentially be found on an actual website for a play or
      in some cases were an extension of jokes made in the play itself.</p>

      <p>Most of the tweets included large pictures that I resized for improved viewing and navigation.
        Sometimes image alignment or text layout was modified in order to emphasize the most
        interesting parts of the tweets.
      I made the decision to italicize hashtags and Twitter handles so as to 'remove' them from
      the tweet's content, in a sense.
      Each tweet's page includes navigation to the other tweets and the home page, with the
      number for the current tweet blacked out so the user is aware of their current page by
      simply looking at the footer.
      The home page gives general information about the play and it
      links to all of the tweets as well as to this about page for convenience,
      as well as to serve as a jumping point and home base for further navigation.</p>
